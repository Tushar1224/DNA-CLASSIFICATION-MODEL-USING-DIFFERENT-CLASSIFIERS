# DNA-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL-USING-DIFFERENT-CLASSIFIERS
 It uses Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Gaussian Process Classiifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Neural Network Classifier,  AdaBoost Classifier,  Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM Classifier (Linear function as activation function), SVM Classifier (RBF function as activation function), SVM Classifier (Sigmoid function as activation function) to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.
